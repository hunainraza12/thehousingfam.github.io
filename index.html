		<h1>5 STEPS TO SUCCESS</h1></div>
		<div class="success-row">
			<div class="success-left">
				<div class="success-heading">
				<h1>STEP 1</h1>
				<p>So you've moved in we kick-start our interaction with weekly support sessions, which are conducted both on a one-to-one basis or within a group setting. You're now enrolled on both in-house and external training courses and are working on developing some form of routine bit-by-bit.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="success-heading">
				<h1>STEP 2</h1>
				<p>You continue to find your feet. Individual target plans are in full force, you and the Housing Fam, are working really hard to balance your independent responsibilities as a parent, whilst achieving your predetermined targets.
<span>Multitask baby!</span> You've began saving money each week, no matter how small the amount. By now, anyone significant within you and baby's life has began their Appropriate Person Assessment <span>(APA)</span> we just need to know they understand how to treatüåüüåü like you and your child. Upon successful completion, they are welcome to stay over for up to three nights per week, because bonds with paternal figures and family members are just as important to us, as they are to you, just book them in with your support manager.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="success-heading">
				<h1>STEP 3</h1>
				<p>Our support levels are beginning to decrease. By now you're clearly showing us that you're en route to getting this whole independent parenting thing. You're displaying abilities within balance of both you and baby's needs, dedication towards academic achievement, practical know-how and upkeep, not to mention you and baby's bond. You now only see our ugly mugs every 3 to 4 weeks for supervision, but, if something changes, just know were flexible.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="success-heading">
				<h1>STEP 4</h1>
				<p>By this point you're flying! Nothing can ‚õî you. You've developed a routine, you cook, clean and wash for you and your child. You're in tune with your child's needs versus wants, you attend all training and at least some of our informal get-togethers, you're well on your way to saving some serious <span>¬£¬£</span>  towards things needed for you and your baby's next steps. Your emotional/mental well-being is A-OK, riding each storm with efficiency and self assurance. You've formed lasting bonds with us here at the Housing Fam and have positive relationships with people you choose to interact with, they stay over regularly, you display clear ability to identify both risk and danger. (you've made it through your first year!) Whoopi # JUST ONE MORE YEAR TO GO
			</div>
			<div class="success-heading">
				<h1>STEP 5</h1>
				<p>where all working really hard to find the next steps best suited to you and babies needs, the Housing Fam is busy liaising with social services and the local authorities in order to appoint the right forwarding accommodation, you and baby are busy preparing for the jump to total independence, don't worry, you've got this you're an absolute warrior.
At this point your strength of mindset, resilience, perseverance and coping mechanism are all on point, you've worked hard for this and now you've achieved complete independence!
